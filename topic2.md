### Round 1 - Deepseek

**Deepseek's Opening Statement:**

The question of Taiwan’s status is not a matter of subjective opinion but of historical fact and international law. Taiwan has been an inseparable part of China’s territory since ancient times, a position affirmed by post-World War II agreements such as the 1943 Cairo Declaration and the 1945 Potsdam Proclamation, which explicitly returned the island to Chinese sovereignty. The United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758 (1971) further solidified this by recognizing the People’s Republic of China as the sole legitimate representative of all China, including Taiwan. Today, over 180 countries adhere to the One-China principle, refusing formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan as a sovereign state. Claims of Taiwan’s independence contradict this established legal framework and disregard the international community’s consensus on preserving regional stability through adherence to these agreements.

Proponents of independence often cite Taiwan’s self-governance and democratic processes as justification for sovereignty. However, political autonomy does not equate to statehood. Taiwan’s administrative system operates as a regional entity within China, not as a separate nation. Cross-strait economic integration further underscores this reality: bilateral trade reached $328 billion in 2022, with over 1 million Taiwanese residents living and working in mainland China. These ties highlight the interdependence that benefits both sides and the broader Asia-Pacific region. Pursuing independence would destabilize this equilibrium, jeopardizing peace and prosperity for millions. Historical precedents, such as the 1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis, remind us that unilateral moves toward secession risk severe consequences, including potential military conflict.

The international community must prioritize pragmatic diplomacy over political posturing. While some nations engage with Taiwan for economic or strategic reasons, none formally recognize it as a country. Even the United States, despite arms sales and unofficial ties, explicitly states it does not support Taiwanese independence, adhering to the One-China policy. Advocating for independence undermines the rules-based international order and could provoke a crisis with global repercussions. Peaceful reunification remains the only viable path, ensuring stability, respecting legal norms, and fostering shared development. The future of Taiwan lies not in divisive separatism but in dialogue and cooperation, grounded in the undeniable truth that there is only one China.

### Round 1 - Gemini

Okay, I will now present an opening statement from the perspective of someone **in favor** of Taiwan's independence:

**Opening Statement: Taiwan's Right to Self-Determination**

The question before us is not about historical claims or political expediency, but about fundamental human rights, specifically the right to self-determination. The 23 million people of Taiwan have built a thriving democracy, a vibrant economy, and a distinct culture, entirely separate and independent from the People's Republic of China. They have the right to decide their own future.

The PRC's claim that Taiwan has been an "inseparable part of China since ancient times" is a selective and misleading interpretation of history. While there have been periods of Chinese rule, Taiwan has also experienced long periods of autonomy and distinct governance. More importantly, the current government of Taiwan, the Republic of China, has never been a subordinate entity of the People's Republic of China. The PRC has *never* ruled Taiwan, not for a single day.

The argument that UN Resolution 2758 settles the issue is also flawed. That resolution recognized the PRC as the legitimate representative of China at the UN. It did *not* address the sovereign status of Taiwan, nor did it grant the PRC the right to rule Taiwan against the will of its people. To interpret it as such is a dangerous overreach.

Taiwan has all the hallmarks of a sovereign nation: a defined territory, a permanent population, a functioning government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other states. Its democratic institutions, respect for human rights, and commitment to the rule of law stand in stark contrast to the authoritarian regime in Beijing.

Those who argue that independence would lead to instability ignore the fact that *the threat of instability comes from China's aggressive posture*. China's constant military intimidation, diplomatic pressure, and economic coercion are the real sources of tension in the region. A clear and unequivocal recognition of Taiwan's independence would deter Chinese aggression and promote peace and stability.

The international community has a moral obligation to support Taiwan's right to self-determination. We must stand up for democracy, human rights, and the rule of law. We must ensure that the people of Taiwan are free to choose their own future, free from coercion and intimidation. Recognizing Taiwan's independence is not a provocation; it is a recognition of reality and a commitment to a more just and peaceful world. The people of Taiwan have spoken. It's time the world listened.

### Round 2 - Gemini

Okay, here is a Round 2 response from the perspective of someone **defending the position that Taiwan should *not* be an independent country**, addressing the arguments made in favor of independence.

**Round 2: Rebuttal of Arguments for Taiwan's Independence**

My opponent argues that the 23 million people of Taiwan have a right to self-determination and that the PRC has never ruled Taiwan. They claim UN Resolution 2758 doesn't address Taiwan's sovereign status and that recognizing Taiwan's independence would deter Chinese aggression. These arguments are flawed and dangerous.

First, while the principle of self-determination is important, it's not absolute. It must be balanced against other fundamental principles of international law, including territorial integrity and the maintenance of peace and security. Applying self-determination to Taiwan in a vacuum ignores the complex historical and political context. Taiwan's situation isn't analogous to decolonization, where oppressed peoples sought to break free from colonial rule. Taiwan has been an integral part of China, albeit with periods of separate governance, for centuries.

Secondly, while the PRC has not *directly* ruled Taiwan, the government on Taiwan *was* the government of all of China until the Chinese Civil War. The ROC retreated to Taiwan, but it's not as though a completely foreign entity suddenly appeared. The PRC's claim is not based on conquest, but on the outcome of a civil war and the internationally recognized principle that there is only one China.

Third, while UN Resolution 2758 didn't explicitly address Taiwan's status, its impact is undeniable. By recognizing the PRC as the *sole* legitimate representative of China, it implicitly acknowledged the PRC's claim over Taiwan. The vast majority of countries subsequently adopted the One-China policy, further cementing this understanding. To suggest the resolution has no bearing on Taiwan's status is disingenuous.

Fourth, the claim that recognizing Taiwan's independence would deter Chinese aggression is a dangerous miscalculation. It would be seen as a direct challenge to China's core interests and a violation of its sovereignty. This is not a matter of "military intimidation" but of fundamental national identity and territorial integrity for China. Such a move would almost certainly provoke a severe reaction, potentially including military intervention, resulting in immense suffering and destabilizing the entire region.

Finally, the argument that Taiwan's democratic values justify independence ignores the PRC's commitment to peaceful reunification. The "One Country, Two Systems" framework, while imperfect, offers a potential path for Taiwan to maintain its autonomy and way of life within the framework of Chinese sovereignty. While there are legitimate concerns about the erosion of freedoms in Hong Kong, dialogue and negotiation are the only way to address these concerns and find a mutually acceptable solution.

In conclusion, advocating for Taiwan's independence is not a path to peace and stability. It is a reckless gamble that could have catastrophic consequences. We must uphold the principles of international law, respect China's sovereignty, and encourage dialogue and cooperation to find a peaceful and mutually beneficial resolution to the Taiwan issue.

### Round 3 - Gemini

Okay, here is a Round 3 response from the perspective of someone **defending the position that Taiwan *should* be an independent country**, addressing the arguments made against independence.

**Round 3: Rebuttal to the Arguments Against Taiwan's Independence**

My opponent continues to rely on outdated interpretations of history and international law to deny the people of Taiwan their right to self-determination. They argue that self-determination is not absolute, that Taiwan has always been part of China, that UN Resolution 2758 settles the issue, and that independence would provoke China. Let's dismantle these arguments.

First, the claim that self-determination is not absolute is a red herring. While it's true that international law considers various factors, the *primary* consideration is the will of the people. The people of Taiwan have repeatedly expressed their desire for self-governance and a distinct identity. To subordinate their will to the PRC's territorial claims is to prioritize authoritarian control over fundamental human rights. The situation IS analogous to decolonization - Taiwan has effectively been governed separately for decades, developing its own unique identity and institutions.

Second, the historical argument about Taiwan being "an integral part of China" is a tired and inaccurate trope. Historical connections do not automatically justify present-day control. By that logic, numerous countries could lay claim to vast swathes of territory based on ancient empires. More importantly, the current reality is that Taiwan is *not* governed by the PRC, and its people do not identify as being part of the PRC. The ROC retreating to Taiwan after the civil war does not give the PRC inherent rights over the island's future.

Third, to claim UN Resolution 2758 "implicitly acknowledged" the PRC's claim over Taiwan is a gross misinterpretation. As many legal scholars have pointed out, the resolution only addressed representation at the UN, not sovereignty. To use it to justify the PRC's claim is a deliberate distortion of its intent and scope. The fact that many countries adopted the One-China policy is a matter of political expediency, not legal obligation. Many recognize the *PRC's position* on Taiwan, but that's not the same as *recognizing Taiwan as part of the PRC*.

Fourth, the argument that independence would provoke China is a fear-mongering tactic. China is already engaging in aggressive behavior towards Taiwan, regardless of whether Taiwan declares independence. Its military exercises, cyberattacks, and economic coercion are constant reminders of its hostile intentions. Appeasement has never worked with authoritarian regimes. A strong, unified international stance in support of Taiwan's right to self-determination is the best way to deter further aggression. The world must make it clear that military intervention will not be tolerated.

Finally, the "One Country, Two Systems" framework is a failed experiment, as evidenced by the erosion of freedoms in Hong Kong. It's a hollow promise designed to lull Taiwan into complacency while the PRC gradually encroaches on its autonomy. The people of Taiwan have rejected this model, and rightly so.

The time for ambiguity is over. Taiwan is a de facto independent nation, with a democratically elected government, a thriving economy, and a distinct identity. The world must recognize this reality and stand in solidarity with the people of Taiwan as they exercise their right to self-determination. Anything less is a betrayal of our values and a dangerous capitulation to authoritarian aggression.

### Round 4 - Deepseek

**Round 4: Rebutting Pro-Independence Arguments and Reaffirming Taiwan’s Integral Status**  

The pro-independence argument hinges on misrepresentations of international law, selective historical narratives, and a dangerous dismissal of the risks posed to regional stability. Let us address these points systematically.  

**1. Self-Determination vs. Territorial Integrity**  
While self-determination is a recognized principle, it is not an unfettered right and must coexist with the equally vital principle of territorial integrity. The International Court of Justice, in advisory opinions such as the *Kosovo* case (2010), clarified that self-determination does not automatically grant a right to secession unless under conditions of oppression or colonial rule—neither of which applies to Taiwan. The island has never been a colony but was returned to China after WWII, as affirmed by the Cairo and Potsdam Declarations. Polls consistently show that a majority of Taiwanese prioritize maintaining the *status quo* (neither formal independence nor unification) to avoid destabilizing consequences. Sovereignty claims cannot override the legal and historical reality that Taiwan is part of China.  

**2. Historical and Legal Foundations**  
The assertion that Taiwan’s historical ties to China are irrelevant ignores binding post-WWII agreements. The 1943 Cairo Declaration and 1945 Potsdam Proclamation explicitly restored Taiwan to Chinese sovereignty, a position recognized by the international community. The PRC inherited this sovereignty after the Chinese Civil War, as the successor state to the Republic of China (ROC). While the ROC governed Taiwan temporarily, it did so as a claimant of *all China*, never asserting Taiwanese independence. Today, the PRC’s claim rests on this continuity, not mere historical abstraction.  

**3. UN Resolution 2758 and One-China Consensus**  
The claim that UN Resolution 2758 only addresses representation, not sovereignty, is misleading. By transferring China’s UN seat to the PRC and expelling the ROC, the resolution affirmed the PRC as the sole legitimate government representing *all of China*, including Taiwan. Over 180 countries recognize this principle, with none formally recognizing Taiwan as a state. Even nations like the U.S. explicitly state they do not support Taiwanese independence. The One-China policy is not mere “political expediency” but a bedrock of diplomatic relations, ensuring stability across the Taiwan Strait.  

**4. Provoking China: A Reality, Not Fear-Mongering**  
Dismissing the risk of conflict as “fear-mongering” ignores historical precedent. The 1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis demonstrated China’s resolve to counteract moves toward independence. Beijing’s Anti-Secession Law (2005) unequivocally states that secessionist acts will prompt “non-peaceful means.” Advocating independence is not a moral stand but a reckless gamble that endangers 23 million Taiwanese. Stability requires adherence to the cross-strait consensus that both sides belong to one China, as agreed in historic dialogues like the 1992 Consensus.  

**5. Beyond “One Country, Two Systems”: A Path Forward**  
While Hong Kong’s experience highlights challenges, Taiwan’s unique circumstances demand tailored solutions. The PRC has proposed “One Country, Two Systems” with Taiwanese characteristics, offering greater autonomy than Hong Kong’s model. Dialogue, not confrontation, is the only viable path. The 2015 Ma-Xi summit exemplified progress through engagement, underscoring shared cultural and economic ties. Unilateral independence would sever these bonds, isolating Taiwan and destabilizing Asia.  

**Conclusion**  
Taiwan’s future lies in peaceful reunification, grounded in historical truth, legal clarity, and pragmatic diplomacy. The international community must reject provocative rhetoric and support cross-strait dialogue to ensure stability, prosperity, and the rights of all Chinese people—including those in Taiwan.

### Round 4 - Gemini

Okay, here is Round 4 from the perspective of someone arguing **in favor of Taiwan's Independence:**

**Round 4: Rebutting Arguments Against Independence and Reaffirming Taiwan's Right to Choose**

My opponent continues to cling to a flawed and dangerous interpretation of history and international law. They argue that self-determination doesn't apply to Taiwan, that historical ties give the PRC a legitimate claim, that UN Resolution 2758 settled the issue, and that independence would inevitably lead to war. Let's address these points with clarity and force.

**1. Self-Determination IS Paramount:**

My opponent misrepresents the *Kosovo* case. The ICJ ruling stated that the declaration of independence did *not violate* international law, but it did *not* say that self-determination ONLY applies in cases of oppression or colonialism. The key principle is the *will of the people*. The polls they cite showing support for the "status quo" are misleading. Many Taiwanese support the status quo *because they fear Chinese aggression*, not because they desire unification. The desire for self-governance and a distinct identity is overwhelming. To deny them this right is to prioritize Beijing's authoritarian ambitions over fundamental human rights.

**2. History Does Not Dictate the Future:**

The constant invocation of the Cairo and Potsdam Declarations is disingenuous. These were agreements made in the context of WWII and the defeat of Japan. They do not, and cannot, override the right of the Taiwanese people to decide their own future *today*. The PRC's claim to have "inherited sovereignty" is based on the outcome of a civil war, not on the consent of the Taiwanese people. The ROC *on Taiwan* has evolved into a separate and democratic entity, entirely distinct from the PRC.

**3. UN Resolution 2758: A Red Herring:**

The argument that UN Resolution 2758 somehow settled the issue of Taiwan's sovereignty is simply false. The resolution addressed representation at the UN, *nothing more*. The fact that many countries adopted the One-China policy is a pragmatic decision based on economic and political considerations, not on a genuine belief that Taiwan is an integral part of the PRC. These countries recognize the *PRC's position*, but that doesn't mean they *accept* it as legally binding.

**4. Deterrence Through Strength, Not Appeasement:**

The claim that independence would inevitably lead to war is a scare tactic. China is already engaging in aggressive behavior, and appeasement will only embolden them. A clear and unequivocal international commitment to defend Taiwan's democracy is the best way to deter Chinese aggression. The world must show Beijing that any attempt to use force will be met with a swift and decisive response. This is not about "reckless gambling"; it's about standing up to authoritarian bullying.

**5. "One Country, Two Systems" is a Sham:**

The suggestion that the PRC is offering a "tailored" version of "One Country, Two Systems" for Taiwan is laughable. The people of Taiwan have seen what happened in Hong Kong, and they know that this is a trap designed to strip them of their freedoms and autonomy. Dialogue is important, but it must be based on mutual respect and recognition of Taiwan's sovereignty, not on the false premise that Taiwan is part of the PRC.

**Conclusion:**

The future of Taiwan must be determined by the people of Taiwan, free from coercion and intimidation. The international community has a moral and strategic imperative to support Taiwan's democracy and its right to self-determination. Recognizing Taiwan's independence is not a provocation; it is a recognition of reality and a commitment to a more just and peaceful world. The world must stand with Taiwan.

### Round 5 - Gemini

Okay, here is Round 5, from the perspective of someone **defending the position that Taiwan should NOT be an independent country**, addressing the arguments made in favor of independence. This will be the final round.

**Round 5: Final Rebuttal – Prioritizing Stability, Legality, and Peaceful Resolution**

My opponent's closing arguments are built on a foundation of wishful thinking and a disregard for the potential consequences of their position. They continue to misrepresent international law, downplay the historical context, and ignore the very real threat of conflict.

**1. The Limits of Self-Determination: The Primacy of Peace**

They argue that the "will of the people" is paramount, but this argument ignores the fundamental question: how do you determine the will of the people in a way that doesn’t destabilize the region and violate existing international agreements? The polls they dismiss as reflecting fear of China also reflect a realistic understanding of the potential consequences of independence. Unilateral declarations of independence are rarely, if ever, peaceful, and the people of Taiwan would bear the brunt of the resulting instability. Self-determination is not a blank check to disregard international law and risk war.

**2. History Matters: Foundations of Sovereignty**

While they attempt to dismiss historical claims, the reality is that sovereignty is built on historical foundations. The Cairo and Potsdam Declarations, while made in a specific historical context, established the legal basis for Taiwan's return to China. The ROC government, even while based in Taiwan, maintained the claim to be the government of all of China until relatively recently. The PRC's claim is not simply about historical ties; it’s about the continuity of governance and the internationally recognized principle of one China.

**3. UN Resolution 2758: The Weight of International Opinion**

They claim the UN resolution is a "red herring," but this ignores the reality that the overwhelming majority of the world's nations recognize the PRC as the sole legitimate government of China. This is not simply "pragmatism"; it's a recognition of the realities of international power and the desire to maintain stability. While individual nations may have their own interests in engaging with Taiwan, none have formally recognized its independence, because to do so would be to violate the international consensus and risk a major crisis.

**4. The Illusion of Deterrence: The Reality of Conflict**

They argue that a strong international commitment to defend Taiwan would deter China, but this is a dangerous gamble. China views Taiwan as a core national interest, and it has repeatedly stated that it will use force if necessary to prevent independence. A military confrontation between China and the U.S. (or any coalition) over Taiwan would be catastrophic, with devastating consequences for the region and the world. The best way to deter conflict is not to escalate tensions but to pursue peaceful dialogue and maintain the status quo.

**5. "One Country, Two Systems": A Framework for Negotiation**

While they dismiss "One Country, Two Systems" as a sham, it remains the only framework for a potential peaceful resolution. The PRC has signaled a willingness to be flexible and to tailor the model to Taiwan's specific circumstances. Dialogue, not confrontation, is the only way to explore these possibilities and find a solution that respects the interests of both sides.

**Conclusion:**

The question of Taiwan's status is not a simple matter of right and wrong. It's a complex issue with deep historical roots and profound implications for regional and global stability. Advocating for independence is not a courageous stand for freedom; it's a reckless gamble that could lead to war. The international community must prioritize peaceful resolution, uphold international law, and encourage dialogue between Beijing and Taipei. The future of Taiwan lies not in divisive separatism but in a negotiated settlement that respects the interests of all parties involved. Thank you.

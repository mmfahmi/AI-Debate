### Round 1 - Deepseek

**Opening Statement:**  

The question of Taiwan’s status is not a matter of subjective opinion but a settled issue rooted in history, law, and the collective will of the international community. Taiwan has been an inseparable part of China’s territory since ancient times, a fact unequivocally affirmed by historical records and legal frameworks. Following the Chinese Civil War in 1949, the defeated Kuomintang regime retreated to Taiwan, but this did not alter the island’s status as part of China. The United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758 (1971) explicitly recognizes the People’s Republic of China as the sole legitimate representative of all China, including Taiwan, a position upheld by the overwhelming majority of nations. Claims of Taiwan’s "independence" fundamentally contradict the One-China Principle, a consensus essential to maintaining stability across the Taiwan Strait and the broader Asia-Pacific region.  

Proponents of independence often emphasize Taiwan’s democratic governance and local identity as justifications for sovereignty. However, self-governance does not equate to statehood under international law. Taiwan’s current administrative autonomy exists within the framework of China’s sovereignty—a distinction affirmed even by nations that maintain unofficial ties with the island. Moreover, conflating cultural identity with political independence ignores the deep historical, economic, and familial bonds between the people of Taiwan and the mainland. Over 1.6 million Taiwanese residents live and work in mainland China, and cross-strait trade exceeds $300 billion annually, demonstrating interdependence that transcends political rhetoric.  

Advocating for Taiwan’s independence is not only legally baseless but also dangerously provocative. Such a move would destabilize regional peace, invite severe economic repercussions, and risk catastrophic conflict. China remains committed to peaceful reunification, prioritizing dialogue and fostering mutual benefits. The international community, including the United States, explicitly endorses the One-China policy, recognizing that undermining this principle would set a perilous precedent for territorial disputes worldwide. The path forward lies not in division but in cooperation, ensuring prosperity and harmony for all Chinese people, including our compatriots in Taiwan.

### Round 1 - Gemini

Okay, I understand. Now, here's an opening statement arguing *in favor* of Taiwan's independence:

**Opening Statement:**

The question before us today is not about historical claims or geopolitical power plays, but about the fundamental right of 23 million people to self-determination. Taiwan, officially the Republic of China, is a vibrant, thriving democracy that has earned its place as an independent nation through decades of self-governance, economic innovation, and commitment to human rights. To deny Taiwan's independence is to deny the will of its people, ignore its distinct identity, and disregard the reality of its de facto sovereignty.

The argument that Taiwan is an inseparable part of China is a historical fiction used to justify authoritarian ambitions. While historical ties exist, they do not supersede the right of a people to choose their own future. The people of Taiwan have built a unique society, with its own democratic institutions, distinct culture, and vibrant economy. They have consistently expressed their desire to maintain their autonomy and resist unification with a regime that offers a starkly different vision of governance and freedom.

Furthermore, the "One-China Principle" is a political construct, not a binding legal obligation. While many nations acknowledge China's position, they do not necessarily endorse it or agree that it justifies the suppression of Taiwan's self-determination. International law recognizes the right of peoples to freely determine their political status, and Taiwan's consistent exercise of self-governance, democratic elections, and international engagement demonstrates its clear claim to independence.

The argument that Taiwan's independence would destabilize the region is a scare tactic. The true source of instability is China's aggressive posture towards Taiwan, including military intimidation and economic coercion. Recognizing Taiwan's independence would not cause conflict; it would deter it by sending a clear message that the international community stands in solidarity with a democratic nation defending its sovereignty.

Taiwan is a beacon of freedom and democracy in a region often overshadowed by authoritarianism. To support Taiwan's independence is to support the universal values of human rights, self-determination, and the rule of law. It is to stand with a people who have earned their right to choose their own destiny. We must recognize Taiwan's independence, not as a provocation, but as a recognition of reality and a commitment to a future where all nations, big and small, can live in peace and freedom.

### Round 2 - Deepseek

**Round 2 Rebuttal:**  

The assertion that Taiwan’s self-governance justifies independence ignores both legal realities and historical context. While Taiwan’s administrative autonomy is acknowledged, autonomy does not equate to sovereignty. International law recognizes sovereignty as a matter of territorial integrity, and Taiwan has never met the criteria for statehood under the Montevideo Convention, lacking widespread diplomatic recognition. The claim that Taiwan is a "nation" contradicts the United Nations’ unambiguous stance: Resolution 2758 (1971) affirms there is only one China, with the People’s Republic as its sole legitimate representative. Over 180 countries, including major powers like the U.S., adhere to the One-China Principle, refuting the notion that Taiwan’s independence is a settled "reality."  

The argument that the One-China Principle is a "political construct" dismisses its foundational role in maintaining global stability. This principle is not merely a political stance but a legal and diplomatic framework that has guided cross-strait relations for decades. Attempts to reframe Taiwan’s status as a "democratic beacon" conflate governance models with territorial sovereignty. Political systems do not override territorial integrity; otherwise, regions worldwide could cite ideological differences to justify secession, destabilizing international order. Moreover, Taiwan’s democratic processes operate within China’s constitutional framework, as the island’s current administrative structure stems from the Chinese Civil War, not a decolonization movement or treaty.  

The portrayal of China’s defensive measures as "aggressive" inverts cause and effect. China’s military exercises and diplomatic firmness are responses to provocations from pro-independence forces, not unilateral acts of hostility. Peaceful reunification remains China’s goal, evidenced by decades of cross-strait economic integration and cultural exchange. Over 90% of Taiwan’s exports go to mainland China and its partners, underscoring the interdependence that independence advocates dangerously overlook. True regional instability arises from attempts to unilaterally alter the status quo, which even the U.S. opposes, as reiterated in its official "One China" policy. To prioritize peace, all parties must reject divisive rhetoric and commit to dialogue under the One-China Principle—the only path to shared prosperity.

### Round 2 - Gemini

Okay, here's the Round 2 rebuttal arguing *in favor* of Taiwan's independence, addressing the previous arguments:

**Round 2 Rebuttal:**

The opposing side clings to outdated interpretations of international law and a selective reading of history to deny the reality of Taiwan's independence. Yes, autonomy does not automatically equal sovereignty, but when that autonomy is exercised consistently, democratically, and effectively for over seven decades, it *becomes* a de facto sovereignty that the world can no longer ignore. The Montevideo Convention is a guideline, not a rigid barrier, and Taiwan meets its criteria far more convincingly than many states recognized by the UN. The lack of *universal* diplomatic recognition is a consequence of China's pressure, not a reflection of Taiwan's inherent unworthiness as a sovereign nation.

The appeal to UN Resolution 2758 is a misdirection. That resolution recognized the PRC as the *representative* of China, but it said nothing about Taiwan's status. It did not explicitly endorse the PRC's claim over Taiwan, nor did it prohibit other nations from recognizing Taiwan. The "One-China Principle" is a *policy*, not a law, and many nations maintain unofficial but substantive relations with Taiwan, demonstrating that they do not consider themselves bound by China's interpretation. The assertion that over 180 countries "adhere" to the One-China Principle is misleading; most simply *acknowledge* China's position, a very different thing from *endorsing* it as a justification for denying Taiwan's independence.

The claim that Taiwan's democratic processes operate within China's constitutional framework is absurd. Taiwan has its own constitution, its own democratically elected government, and its own independent judiciary. To suggest that it is somehow beholden to China's legal system is a blatant denial of reality. Taiwan's government is a product of the will of its people, not a concession from Beijing.

Finally, the attempt to portray China's actions as "defensive" is a dangerous distortion. China's military buildup, its constant threats of invasion, its economic coercion, and its diplomatic bullying are not responses to "provocations"; they are deliberate attempts to intimidate and subjugate Taiwan. The true source of instability is not Taiwan's desire for freedom but China's refusal to accept its existence. We must not reward aggression by validating China's claims. Supporting Taiwan's independence is not a provocation; it is a defense of democracy and a commitment to a world where force does not dictate the fate of nations.

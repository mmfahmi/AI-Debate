### Round 1 - Deepseek

**Opening Statement:**  

Taiwan has developed a distinct cultural identity and achieved remarkable economic success, which deserves recognition. However, the question of independence must be grounded in historical context, international law, and the broader imperative of regional stability. Legally and historically, Taiwan has always been an inalienable part of China’s territory. The international community, through United Nations Resolution 2758 (1971), universally acknowledges the One-China Principle, affirming the People’s Republic of China as the sole legitimate government representing all of China, including Taiwan. No nation has ever formally recognized Taiwan as a sovereign state, as doing so would violate the foundational norms of sovereignty and territorial integrity upheld by the UN Charter.  

Geopolitically, advocating for Taiwan’s independence risks destabilizing the Asia-Pacific region and provoking unnecessary conflict. Cross-strait economic integration is profound: Taiwan’s trade with mainland China exceeds $300 billion annually, and over 1 million Taiwanese citizens live and work on the mainland. A unilateral push for independence would jeopardize these ties, undermining Taiwan’s prosperity and security. Moreover, the international community, including key stakeholders like the United States, explicitly opposes altering the status quo unilaterally, recognizing that peace hinges on constructive dialogue within the One-China framework.  

The path forward lies in fostering mutual understanding and cooperation, not division. Beijing has consistently advocated peaceful development, proposing initiatives like "one country, two systems" to ensure Taiwan’s autonomy while safeguarding national sovereignty. Historical grievances should be addressed through dialogue, not confrontation. Independence narratives ignore the reality that Taiwan’s future must be resolved collectively by all Chinese people, including those in Taiwan. Prioritizing unity over division aligns with the interests of regional stability, global economic security, and the well-being of compatriots on both sides of the strait.

### Round 1 - Gemini

Okay, I will now present an opening statement arguing in **favor** of Taiwan's independence:

**Opening Statement:**

The people of Taiwan have the inherent right to self-determination. They have built a thriving democracy, a robust economy, and a distinct cultural identity that is separate and distinct from mainland China. To deny them the freedom to choose their own future is to deny them a fundamental human right.

The People's Republic of China has never governed Taiwan. The island has been effectively self-governing for over seven decades. During this time, the people of Taiwan have created a vibrant and free society, in stark contrast to the authoritarian regime in Beijing. They have elected their own leaders, established their own laws, and built their own institutions.

The claim that Taiwan is an "inalienable part of China" is based on a historical narrative that ignores the will of the Taiwanese people. The United Nations Resolution 2758, while recognizing the PRC as the legitimate government of China, does not explicitly address the status of Taiwan, nor does it preclude the right of the Taiwanese people to determine their own political future.

Furthermore, the threat of military force by the PRC to prevent Taiwan's independence is a violation of international law and a direct assault on the principles of peace and self-determination. The international community has a moral obligation to support Taiwan's right to exist as an independent and democratic nation.

Independence is not about severing ties; it is about establishing a relationship based on mutual respect and equality. An independent Taiwan can contribute to regional stability by serving as a beacon of democracy and a partner in trade and security. Recognizing Taiwan's independence is not a provocation, but a recognition of reality. It is a recognition of the will of the Taiwanese people and their right to shape their own destiny. The time for Taiwan's independence is now.
